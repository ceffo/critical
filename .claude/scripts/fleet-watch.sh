#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fleet-watch.sh: the supervisor's ONE watcher over its live agents (every herdr agent except sup-*).
# Run it with run_in_background. Polls `herdr agent list` every 30 s and exits when an agent:
#   - becomes blocked (a permission prompt or question in its tab; not scoper-*/designer-*, whose
#     questions are for the user)                                                 -> "BLOCKED <name>"
#   - ends a turn (working -> idle/done) and its last screen speaks to the supervisor
#     (supervisor / ship / push / PR / merge), or its report file is newer than   -> "NEEDS-SUPERVISOR <name>"
#     the last prompt it got
#   - disappears                                                                   -> "GONE <name>"
#   - ends a turn on a question or a request to the user (herdr shows it as idle/done, not blocked)
#                                                                                  -> "WAITING-ON-USER <name>"
# Waiting (a question) or blocked: the agent's tab gets a "❓ " / "⛔ " prefix and a herdr notification
# (sound "request") so the user sees it; the prefix goes when the agent works again. scoper-* and
# designer-* talk to the user by design: they get the mark and the notification, but don't wake the
# supervisor. Agents already waiting when the watcher starts are marked, not reported.
# Only the agents of this herdr workspace ($HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID) are watched.
# An agent ending a turn that only talks to the user (live steps, a scoper's questions) doesn't wake it.
# Prints the agent's last lines. Records its pid in supervisor/fleet-watch.pid, which the Stop hook
# (.claude/hooks/supervisor-ci-guard.sh) checks: a supervisor can't end a turn with live agents and no
# fleet watcher. Starting a new one replaces (kills) the previous one.
